# PetFeedingMachine
This paper presents the making of a pet feeding machine using the PIC16F877A microcontroller, in addition to a few different I/O components that include an LCD, servo-motor, RFID tags, ultra-sonic and an Arduino Uno. The general idea of this project revolves around allowing pet owners to automatically feed their pets without having to be physically present, it offers personalized tags for each pet which enables users to control the amount of food and meal times for every single pet individually, and thus food is dispensed accordingly. All electric design, programming and working mechanism details are to be thoroughly explained in this report.
